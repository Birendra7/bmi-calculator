## 📚 How It Works  

1. **Input Fields**: Users enter their height (in cm or inches) and weight (in kg or lbs).  
2. **Calculation**: The JavaScript function calculates BMI using the formula:  
   ```plaintext
   BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]²
   ```  
3. **Result Display**: The website displays the BMI value and the corresponding health category.
